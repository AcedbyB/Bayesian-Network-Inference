To run my code, simply compile every .java file in every package of this folder and then run the Main class.
I have tried very hard to name every variable and function very carefully so that someone who has never seen it
before could understand it pretty well.

To be brief, I have 4 type of inference included in the base package and they all wil be demonstrated inside the Main class.
Arguments for the main class should be this form: aima-alarm.xml B J true M true
You will be asked which inference to use when running the Main class.

The rest of the guide needed to test my code would be in the running process and also in the submission form
included with it.
